Yesterday I studied ~300 practice questions for Network+.

Today I installed VSCode and Docker Desktop and created this blog using Jekyll with Github Actions and Github Pages.

I altered the _config.yml file to add a few personal details to the site.

I then created this first blog post.

For my class at CIAT, I did two labs in Packet Tracer:
* I tinkered with the DNS settings to connect web pages stored on a server to become accessible to connected devices.
* I connected to a router's network using both wired and wireless networks.
* I used DHCP to assign a variety of devices to the wired network.
* I assigned subnet masks according to the classless networks I created, which accomodated for 62 and 30 devices between two different networks.
* And more!
